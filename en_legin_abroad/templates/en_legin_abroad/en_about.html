        <p style='width: 600px; margin-left: 15px; font-size: 110%; text-align: center;'>Hi! My name is Alex, and I studied physics for some time. Iâ€™ve been living abroad for a long time and have over three years of experience in Python development and testing.
          On this platform, I share my thoughts on travel, student life in the Czech Republic, my experience of almost a year spent in Japan, and many other topics.
          <br>
            I hope my experiences and insights will be interesting to someone.
